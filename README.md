# Energy-Australia-Appium-Coding-Test

Note: This sample Appium Test Framework is designed using the Maven build tool with Page Object Model and Cucumber BDD plugin. We've used the actual Android app of 'Energy Australia' and automated the 'Register' feature with Invalid credentials on a real device.

Pre-requisites to running this project:
The following softwares & dependencies needs to be installed:
1) JDK 1.8 and the later versions.
2) Eclipse IDE.
3) NodeJS - As appium is based on Node JS.
4) Latest Appium dependencies.
5) Appium GUI Server
6) Appium Inspector
7) Android Studio needs to be installed and configured accordingly.

Note: Please refer the POM.xml for the Maven dependencies.

Environment variables to be set:
1) ANDROID_HOME
2) JAVA_HOME
3) MAVEN_HOME
3) PATH environment variable needs to be updated to point to the JAVA_HOME & ANDROID_HOME.

Note: Before running the Framework, ensure that the real device is connected with 'developer options' enabled and adb showing the devices on the terminal.
      Also the Appium needs to running.
      
In case of any issues in running the Framework, kindly email me at 'swaroopsonline@gmail.com'
